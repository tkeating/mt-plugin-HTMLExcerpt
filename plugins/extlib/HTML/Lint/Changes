2.10    Tue Dec  6 11:16:16 CST 2011

        HTML::Lint is now explicitly licensed under Artistic License 2.0,
        instead of the vague "same terms as Perl itself."

        [FIXES]
        Tags that were self-closed were being ignored.  For example, if you had

            <img src="blah.jpg" />

        then HTML::Lint would ignore the tag.  This has been fixed.


2.06    Thu Dec 18 00:07:54 CST 2008
        [FIXES]
        Added attributes to <frameset>.

        <strong> tag didn't allow any attributes.  Now it does.

        Removed the <listing> tag.


2.04    Mon Jun  2 11:41:16 CDT 2008
        [FIXES]
        <textarea> now knows about the wrap attribute.

        [INTERNALS]
        Lots of enhancements pointed out by Perl::Critic.


2.02    Thu Nov  3 11:49:18 CST 2005
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * The warnings for missing ALT and HEIGHT/WIDTH on your images
          now give the SRC attribute.

2.00    Tue Sep 20 23:10:39 CDT 2005
        [CHANGES THAT COULD BREAK YOUR CODE]
        * I've changed the object structure.  HTML::Lint now has-a
          HTML::Parser, and no longer is-a HTML::Parser.

        * weblint-cgi and weblint-original are no longer distributed
          with HTML::Lint.

        * Now requires Perl 5.6.0.

        [FIXES]
        * Line numbering is now correct if you parse more than one file.

        * Changed t/*.*.t so that they only had one period in the
          filename. Apparently VMS doesn't like filenames with multiple
          dots.

1.30    December 3, 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added handling for <HTML xmlns=... xml:lang=...>

        * Fixed <EMBED pluginspace=...>

        * Added handling of <EMBED quality=... and play=...>

1.28    January 27, 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added support for the <EMBED> tag.

        [INTERNALS]
        * Added more POD coverage.

1.26    December 23, 2003
        [FIXES]
        * Fixed warnings if a lint error was found in the first column
          of the input file.  Thanks, Adam Monsen.

1.25    December 19, 2003
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * html_ok() clears the HTML::Lint object that gets passed
          in, if any.  Thanks to Cees Hek.

        [INTERNALS]
        * Ran everything through Devel::Cover to see what wasn't
          getting exercised.
        * Removed _element_stack() which was never used.
        * Error.pm's internals now eat their own dog food of methods,
          rather than accessing internals directly.
        * line(), column() and file() are no longer setters in
          HTML::Lint.  I sure hope this doesn't break anything for
          anyone.
        * Removed some explicit "return undef" stuff.

1.24    September 11, 2003
        [FIXES]
        * Removed the check for "input tags can have height &
          width", because they can't.

1.23    September 02, 2003
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * The types of errors to find may now be passed in the
          HTML::Lint constructor.
        * Can now export the error types from HTML::Lint::Error.

        [DOCUMENTATION]
        * Fixed a bug in Test::HTML::Lint docs. (Thanks to Leon
          Brocard and about 90 other people)

1.22    JUNE 11, 2003
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added some docs explaining html_ok()'s optional lint object.
        * Allowed the NAME attribute in the <IMG> tag.

        [FIXES]
        * Fixed the version check in t/99.pod.t

1.21    October 9, 2002
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added a test file for pod files
        * html_ok() now diag()s the test name before spewing the errors.
        * Made some docs a little more explicit. (Thanks to Ron Savage)
        * Added the check for missing <HTML>, <HEAD>, <TITLE> and <BODY>.
        * Added the check for nonrepeatable tags.

        [FIXES]
        * Ticket #1493: typo in HTML::Lint::HTML4 
          <ADDRESS> element in HTML4.pm was <ADDRESSS>.  Thanks to Dominic
          Mitchell for finding it.

1.20    August 22, 2002
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Made it run under 5.5.3

1.13    August 5, 2002
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added text-use-entity for detecting control characters.

1.12    August 2, 2002
        [FIXES]
        * No longer squawks on html_ok( undef ).  It now specifically fails.

1.11    July 25, 2002
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added the concept of HTML::Lint::Error type, which is one of
          Structure, Helper or Fluff.
        * weblint now takes --[no]structure, --[no]helper, --[no]fluff.
        * Added the ability to overload html_ok()'s HTML::Lint object
          with one of your own.

        [FIXES]
        * Fixed line number goof in Test::HTML::Lint
        * Fixed line positions in weblint on files (URL reading was OK)

1.10    July 17, 2002
        * Added Test::HTML::Lint
        * Removed the "use 5.6.0" from everywhere
        * Included Neil Bowers' original weblint script, in the
          weblint-original/ directory.  Note that it does NOT get
          installed.

1.02    July 8, 2002
        * No functional changes.  It's all in the test suite.
        * Added a whole mess of *.t files.  They've been in CVS all along,
          but I forgot to put them in the MANIFEST.  Ooops.

1.01    July 3, 2002
        * Tests use isa_ok() for more stringent checking of return objects
        * Added <nobr>.  Ooopsie.

1.00    June 5, 2002
        * weblint has a --context option to show the line that the error
          occurs on.
        * Removed the original weblint log from this Changes file.
        * Fixed: Unknown tags wouldn't get put into the stack, so you
          would get two errors: One complaining that it didn't know the
          tag, and another that the closing tag didn't make sense.

0.94    May 31, 2002
        * Moved the %HTML::Lint::Error::errors hash to be a package
          variable, and not initialize it in an INIT block.

0.93    May 28, 2002    
        * weblint can now read URLs as well as files
        * Improved the docs in HTML::Lint::Error.

0.92    February 26, 2001
        * Removed the INIT block in HTML::Error in preparation for
          Apache::Lint, and so brian's weblint++ can use it.
        * errors() method respects wantarray (brian d foy)
        * file(), line(), column(), errcode() and errtext() all return
          blank instead of undef.

0.91    January 8, 2002
        * Fixed: Content description tags (<CITE>, <EM>, etc) were
          not seen as being valid tags.

0.90    July 8, 2001
        First version of the rewrite as a subclass of HTML::Parser
